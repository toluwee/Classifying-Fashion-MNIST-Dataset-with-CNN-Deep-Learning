# Classifying Horses and Humans with CNN Deep Learning

## Project Overview
I created an image classification application using a deep neural network with convolutions. This application trains a deep learning model on a dataset of images. It then uses the trained model to classify new images.

## Key Skills Demonstrated:
Tensorflow and Neural networks


## About dataset
Horses or Humans is a dataset of 300Ã—300 images, created by Laurence Moroney, that is licensed CC-By-2.0 for anybody to use in learning or testing computer vision algorithms. The dataset contains 500 rendered images of various species of horse in various poses in various locations. It also contains 527 rendered images of humans in various poses and locations. Emphasis has been taken to ensure diversity of humans, and to that end there are both men and women as well as Asian, Black, South Asian and Caucasians present in the training set. The validation set adds 6 different figures of different gender, race and pose to ensure breadth of data.


## Objective
To create a model that correctly classifies images as horses or humans
